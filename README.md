This is a repo for my quiz project.

This is my week two project assignment for the Nov '23 Software Development Bootcamp at The Developer Academy.

The aim of this project is to create a quiz that will ask a series of questions and produce a result on completion of all the questions. The quiz is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's on a single page and the total score is displayed after answering all five questions. 

Here is the quiz: https://tapetone.github.io/astroquizproject/

Let me know your score.
